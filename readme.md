This project has been deprecated. While most of it might still work, there's no interest in maintaining and keeping support with future updates to the API.

# Development

The library will be in development while it's in v0.

## Library Goals

1. All regular endpoints supported with doc
2. ~~Able to move all runs from one category to another~~ -> Should be working as of 0.1.x
3. Moving all runs across games
4. Able to edit all runs of one category/game
5. Able to get all run information over time for a game and category
6. Get all pending runs or all newly submitted runs in a time frame
7. Properly handle getting rate-limited
8. Optimize functions in the end to minimize redundant requests
9. More depending on suggestions

## Documentation

Public API documentation should be created and mantained after v1.
