2. Able to move all runs from one category to another
3. Able to edit all runs of one category/game
4. Able to get all run information over time for a game and category
5. Get all pending runs or all newly submitted runs in a time frame
6. Properly handle getting rate-limited
7. Optimize functions in the end to minimize redundant requests
8. More depending on suggestions
